controlling the altino robot on webot using fuzzy logic control for walking on uphill and downhill arenas.
input Fuzzy : Error and Delta Error
*Error obtained from Accelerometer readings The set point is set at 0 so that the sensor can detect the arena uphill or downhill, if the sensor is plus then the arena is uphill and if the sensor is minus then the arena is downhill.
Output : Singal PWM
*PWM signal will be converted into RPM using the equation already contained in the programme.
